## Content Guidelines for Each Post

### Structure (1500-2500 words each):
1. **Hook** (First 100 words) - Address the pain point directly
2. **Quick Answer** - Give value immediately (helps with featured snippets)
3. **Deep Dive** - Detailed explanation with subheadings
4. **Actionable Tips** - Numbered lists, bullet points
5. **Real Examples** - Screenshots, before/after (use PicLoreAI examples)
6. **CTA** - Natural mention of PicLoreAI as solution

### SEO Elements:
- H1: Title with primary keyword
- H2s: Include secondary keywords
- Meta description: 155 characters, include keyword
- URL: /blog/target-keyword-here
- Alt text: Descriptive, keyword-rich
- Internal links: Link to other blog posts
- External links: 2-3 authoritative sources

### What Makes Content "Not Feel AI-Written":
1. **Personal anecdotes** - "When I updated my LinkedIn photo..."
2. **Specific data points** - "According to LinkedIn's 2024 data..."
3. **Contrarian takes** - Challenge common advice
4. **Real tool comparisons** - Mention competitors honestly
5. **Screenshots & visuals** - Add real examples
6. **Conversational tone** - Use "you" frequently
7. **Specific numbers** - "$250 average" not "expensive"
