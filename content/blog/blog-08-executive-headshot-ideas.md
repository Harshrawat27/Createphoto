Executive headshots carry weight. They appear on board presentations, press releases, company websites, and annual reports.

The right executive portrait communicates leadership before you say a word. Here are 15 styles that work.

## What Makes an Executive Headshot Different

Executive headshots differ from standard professional headshots in key ways:

- **Higher production value** expected
- **More formal** attire and settings
- **Authority signaling** takes priority
- **Used in high-stakes contexts** (investor decks, media, boards)
- **Longevity matters** (you'll use it for years)

The goal: look like someone who leads, not just someone who works.

## Executive Headshot Mistakes to Avoid

### The Over-Retouched Look

Executives need to appear authentic. Heavy retouching that removes wrinkles and life experience can backfire—it suggests vanity and inauthenticity.

**Better approach:** Natural enhancement that looks like a good day, not a different person.

### The Power Pose Overload

Aggressive body language (crossed arms, stern expression) can read as defensive or unapproachable rather than powerful.

**Better approach:** Confidence doesn't require intimidation. Calm authority beats aggressive posturing.

### The Outdated Photo

Using a photo from 10+ years ago creates problems when you meet people in person.

**Better approach:** Update every 2-3 years, or when appearance changes significantly.

### The Inconsistent Set

If your executive team's headshots are all different styles, it looks disorganized.

**Better approach:** For team pages, maintain stylistic consistency across executives.

## AI for Executive Headshots

Modern AI headshot generators can create executive-quality portraits:

**Advantages:**
- Try multiple styles without multiple photoshoots

## Action Steps

1. **Audit your current headshot:** Does it project the leadership brand you want?
2. **Identify your primary use case:** Board materials? Press? General professional?
3. **Choose 1-2 styles** from this list that fit your needs
4. **Get the shot:** Professional photographer or quality AI generator
5. **Update your presence:** LinkedIn, company site, speaker profiles, bio pages

Your executive headshot represents you when you're not in the room. Make sure it's saying what you want it to say.
