I spoke with 15 HR managers and recruiters about what they actually notice in headshots. The answers might surprise you.

Here's the unfiltered truth about what matters in corporate headshots—and what's just photographer marketing.

## What HR Professionals Actually Said

When asked "What do you notice first in a candidate's headshot?", the top answers were:

1. **Professionalism (generic)** - "Do they look like they take themselves seriously?"
2. **Eye contact** - "Are they looking at the camera? It matters more than you'd think."
3. **Appropriate attire** - "Is it suitable for our company culture?"
4. **Authenticity** - "Does this photo look like them, or is it overly edited?"
5. **Recency** - "Is this clearly a 10-year-old photo?"

What they **didn't** mention:
- Specific background colors
- Lighting setup quality
- Whether a professional photographer shot it
- Resolution (unless it was noticeably bad)

This tells us something important: HR cares about signals of professionalism, not technical photography metrics.

## The "Would I Introduce This Person to a Client?" Test

One HR director gave me this framework:

> "I look at headshots and ask: would I be comfortable introducing this person to our most important client? If the answer is yes, the photo works."

This encapsulates everything. Your corporate headshot needs to pass the client introduction test.

What fails this test:
- Casual vacation photos
- Overly glamorous, magazine-style shots
- Dated photos that don't match current appearance
- Low-effort selfies
- Inappropriate attire or backgrounds

What passes:
- Clean, professional appearance
- Appropriate industry attire
- Confident but approachable expression
- Recent, accurate representation

## Industry-Specific Standards

Corporate culture varies dramatically. What works at a law firm would look stuffy at a tech startup. Here's what HR expects by industry:

### Conservative Industries (Finance, Legal, Insurance)

**Expected:**
- Business formal (suit and tie for men, professional blazer for women)
- Neutral backgrounds
- Minimal accessories
- Conservative colors (navy, charcoal, black)

**Red flags HR mentioned:**
- Visible tattoos (still matters in these industries, unfortunately)
- Creative or colorful backgrounds
- Casual attire
- Heavy retouching

**Quote from a banking HR manager:** "We want candidates who look like they could walk into a board meeting. The headshot sets expectations."

### Professional Services (Consulting, Accounting)

**Expected:**
- Business professional (jacket, no tie is often acceptable)
- Clean, modern backgrounds
- Professional but approachable expression
- Muted, coordinated colors

**Red flags:**
- Overly casual (no jacket)
- Distracting backgrounds
- Glamour-style shots

### Tech / Startups

**Expected:**
- Smart casual to business casual
- Can show more personality
- Modern, clean aesthetics
- Solid color shirts without jacket often acceptable

**What actually works here:**
- Quality t-shirts with clean backgrounds
- More genuine smiles
- Slightly less formal poses
- Creative backgrounds (within reason)

**Quote from a startup HR lead:** "Overdressed photos actually concern me. It signals someone who might not fit our culture."

### Healthcare

**Expected:**
- Professional attire (white coat if appropriate)
- Trustworthy expression
- Clean, clinical or neutral backgrounds
- Conservative but warm

**Red flags:**
- Overly casual
- Aggressive or unapproachable expressions
- Distracting backgrounds

### Creative Industries (Marketing, Design, Media)

**Expected:**
- More room for personal expression
- Can show personality through style
- Creative backgrounds acceptable
- Still needs professionalism as foundation

**What actually helps:**
- Unique color choices that show design sense
- More dynamic poses
- Personality that matches your work
- Still fundamentally professional

## The Authenticity Paradox

Here's something interesting from the interviews: HR managers are increasingly skeptical of overly polished photos.

**Quote:** "I've had candidates show up looking nothing like their headshot. It starts the interview on a dishonest foot. I'd rather see an authentic photo than a heavily edited one."

This doesn't mean you shouldn't look your best. It means:

- **Do:** Good lighting, professional attire, your best natural self
- **Don't:** Filters that change your face shape, heavy skin smoothing that removes all texture, photos from when you were 30 pounds lighter

The goal is your best authentic self—not a fictional version of you.

### AI Headshots and Authenticity

Modern AI headshots walk this line well when done correctly. The key is training the AI on accurate, recent photos of yourself. The output looks professional and polished, but it's still recognizably you.

Where it goes wrong: using AI to make yourself look dramatically different than reality.

## The Technical Minimum (What HR Actually Notices)

HR managers aren't photographers. They don't evaluate f-stops or color grading. But they do notice:

### Things That Register as "Unprofessional"

1. **Grainy/pixelated images** - "It looks like they don't care"
2. **Cropped group photos** - "Clearly low effort"
3. **Webcam quality** - "Shows they haven't invested in their professional presence"
4. **Weird cropping** - Cut-off heads, too much space, awkward framing
5. **Bathroom/bedroom backgrounds** - "Immediately changes my perception"

### Things HR Doesn't Notice

1. **Exact lighting setup** - They don't know studio from natural
2. **Camera brand** - Smartphone vs DSLR doesn't register
3. **Specific background color** - As long as it's appropriate
4. **Professional photographer vs DIY** - Can't tell if done well

This is good news: you don't need expensive photography, you need competent photography that meets basic professional standards.

## The Remote Work Complication

With remote work prevalent, headshot standards have shifted slightly:

**More acceptable now:**
- Home office backgrounds (if clean)
- Slightly more casual attire
- Virtual backgrounds (if done well)

**Still not acceptable:**
- Messy visible backgrounds
- Clearly in bed
- Poor lighting
- Ring light catchlights in eyes (signals "Zoom call")

For remote positions, HR managers said they're less concerned about traditional studio headshots and more concerned about seeing that you can present professionally on video calls.

## Red Flags That Cause Immediate Doubt

HR managers were candid about photos that raise concerns:

1. **Dramatically outdated photos** - "If they're hiding how they look now, what else are they hiding?"

2. **Inappropriate attire** - "I had a candidate with a headshot in a tuxedo at what was clearly a wedding. It showed poor judgment."

3. **Aggressive expressions** - "Intimidating photos make me wonder about their personality."

4. **Overly sexualized photos** - "Instant no. It shows they don't understand professional norms."

5. **Unprofessional settings** - "Beach photos, party photos—they signal someone who doesn't get business context."

6. **No photo at all** - "On LinkedIn, no photo is worse than a mediocre photo. It makes me wonder what they're hiding."

## What Actually Gets You Interviews

HR managers said these photos help candidates:

### High Correlation with Interview Invites:

1. **Confident eye contact** - Looking directly at camera
2. **Genuine smile** - Not forced, not stiff
3. **Appropriate attire** - Matching or exceeding company culture
4. **Professional quality** - Doesn't need to be expensive
5. **Recency** - Clearly represents how you look now

### The Competence-Warmth Balance

This came up repeatedly: the best headshots balance looking capable with looking likable.

- **Too serious:** Competent but cold
- **Too smiley:** Friendly but not professional
- **The sweet spot:** Confident and approachable

One HR manager put it perfectly: "I want to see someone I'd trust with a project AND someone I'd enjoy grabbing lunch with."

## Creating Your Corporate Headshot

Based on HR feedback, here's the process:

### Step 1: Research Your Target Company

Look at:
- Leadership team headshots on the company website
- Employee LinkedIn photos
- Company culture signals (casual vs formal)

Match your headshot to be slightly more formal than the average.

### Step 2: Choose Appropriate Attire

- **Conservative industry:** Business formal
- **Professional services:** Business professional
- **Tech/startup:** Smart casual minimum
- **Creative:** Professional with personality

When in doubt, go more formal. You can always untuck a shirt, but you can't add a jacket post-shoot.

### Step 3: Focus on Expression

Practice in a mirror:
- Natural smile (think of something genuinely funny)
- Direct eye contact
- Slight chin forward
- Relaxed shoulders

### Step 4: Get the Shot

Options:
1. Professional photographer ($200-400)
2. AI headshot generator ($10-50)
3. DIY with good lighting

All work if executed well. HR can't tell the difference if the quality meets professional standards.

### Step 5: Test Reactions

Before setting as your official photo:
- Ask colleagues for honest feedback
- Show to people who don't know you well
- Ask: "What's your first impression?"

## The Bottom Line

HR managers care about professionalism signals, not photography technique. A well-lit smartphone photo with appropriate attire beats a professionally shot but culturally inappropriate photo.

Focus on:
- Matching your target company's culture
- Authentic representation
- Basic technical quality
- Appropriate, confident expression

Your headshot is a first impression. Make it count—but don't overthink the technical details.
